Gerrymandering is the practice of setting boundaries of electoral districts to favor specific political interests within legislative bodies. In this project, we intend to create a model that outputs a plausible set of district lines to favour one political party and/or make it as fair as possible. The precinct census data and voting history of all votes in a state is gathered from the datasets mentioned below and processed. An unsupervised clustering model is trained on this data to output a two-dimensional array of precincts in each district. We then use a reinforcement learning model  This data is visualised on a map of the state, giving the desired gerrymandered and/or fair district lines. Although partisan gerrymandering has not been deemed unconstitutional by the federal court, we find it unethical to do so in a real-world setting. This project is intended to be an academic exploration. We do not condone or consent to individuals or organisations who wish to use our model in a non-academic setting.
